Welcome to the software portion of my Homelab adventure.

Here I will do my best to describe what I call the "core software" or "core services" of my Homelab - The software and services without which, the whole network would not function.

On the left navigation pane, you will find the core services of my Homelab, separated by protocol or system. Please select the protocol/system name for a very brief overview of what that protocol/system is and how it fits within my Homelab or skip straight to the service name to find out exactly how I have configured it.
